# smc
Contains some sequential monte carlo methods from my research. 

- smc_samplers.py contains generic class for implementing a sequential monte carlo sampler
- smc_path_estimators.py contains a collection of classes that can be use for path estimation and selection

Implementations of these classes can be found in models/path_estimators and models/samplers. Demonstrations of these methods can be found as ipython notebooks in the demos directory. Stan models and data are found in their respective folders.
